                        Kidney stones, tiny mineral deposits that form in the kidneys, can bring excruciating pain.

                        These are common signs of kidney stones.

                    Kidney stones, while small, can cause significant discomfort and, in some cases, lead to severe complications.
                    They form when certain substances in your urine become highly concentrated, crystallizing and creating solid masses within the kidneys.
                    Factors like dehydration, dietary habits (high in salt or protein),
                    family history, and certain medical conditions contribute to their development.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    If you experience sharp, stabbing pain in your back or side, often radiating to the lower abdomen or groin,
                    it could indicate a kidney stone passing through the urinary tract.
                    Symptoms like blood in urine, nausea, persistent urge to urinate, or fever suggest complications requiring immediate attention.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    Timely intervention prevents complications like urinary tract obstruction, kidney damage, or recurring kidney stones in Conroe, Shenandoah, Houston, or The Woodlands, TX.
                    Your kidney doctor will conduct tests, including imaging and urine analysis, to diagnose, offer treatment options, and suggest preventive measures tailored to your condition,
                    ensuring better kidney health and minimizing future occurrences.

                    Kidney Stones: Diagnosis and Treatment
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    Diagnosing kidney stones involves a physical exam, imaging tests like CT scans or ultrasounds, and analysis of urine samples to confirm their presence.
                    Treatment varies based on the stone's size and severity. Small stones usually pass naturally with increased fluid intake and pain medication.
                    Larger stones might require procedures like lithotripsy to break them into smaller pieces for easier passage or surgical intervention in complex cases.
