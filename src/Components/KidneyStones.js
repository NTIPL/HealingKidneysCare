                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    One of the most effective treatments for kidney stones is a procedure known as Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy, abbreviated as ESWL.
                    This kidney stone treatment uses shock waves to break up the kidney stone into smaller pieces which can then pass out of your body through your urine.
                </p>

                {/* The ESWL Procedure */}
                <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl text-gray-600 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The ESWL Procedure</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    ESWL is usually performed on an outpatient basis, typically under IV sedation, so you will need to bring someone with you to drive you home after the procedure.
                    After treatment, small pieces of the kidney stone will pass within a few weeks.
