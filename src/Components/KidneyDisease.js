                    While we don’t often think about it, our kidneys do so much for us! These organs are essential for filtering out toxins and waste from the bloodstream while also delivering important nutrients, vitamins, and hormones throughout the body. When kidneys don’t function properly, it's important to turn to our experienced nephrologists at The Healing Kidneys Institute of Houston for comprehensive care.

                The warning signs of kidney disease are not unique to this condition, so you may not immediately recognize that you could be dealing with kidney issues. 
                It’s important to turn to us right away if you notice these symptoms:

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                We will first need to determine what’s causing your symptoms before we can determine how to best treat it. 
                After all, how we address acute kidney problems will be different from how we treat chronic kidney issues. 
                The good news is that most kidney diseases can be properly treated or managed with the proper medication and lifestyle changes. 
                Those with more advanced stages of kidney disease will benefit from dialysis, which helps to filter the blood of toxins and waste when the kidneys no longer can.
